# QU Study Plan Manager (🚧 Under development 🚧)



**QU Study Plan Manager** is a dynamic, interactive web application that allows students at Qatar University to visually organize and plan their academic courses across multiple years and semesters. Inspired by the official study plan flowcharts provided by QU, this tool simplifies the academic journey by making course planning intuitive and user-friendly.
